# mrt-data-integration

Simulation code for *Data integration methods for micro-randomized trials* by Easton Huch, Inbal Nahum-Shani, Lindsey Potter, Cho Lam, David Wetter, and Walter Dempsey.

The code for the main simulation is in the file `simulation.R`, which we ran using R version 4.4.1.
The file `sensitivity.R` contains the sensitivity analyses in the Web Appendix.
Running these two files creates all simulation tables and figures in the paper and its Web Appendix.

The file `example-analysis.R` gives a simple example of analyzing simulated data.
This file produces `example_dat.csv` and `example_estimates.csv`.
